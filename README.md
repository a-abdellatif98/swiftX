# Functionality requirements

- Authentication: Create account / login / logout.
- When logged in, a user can view, edit and delete entered `jogging times`.
- Implement three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time.
- Filter by dates from-to.
- Report on average speed & distance per week.
- Demonstrate how your API works by writing examples using a REST client like Postman, cURL, or using swagger.
